## ✨ Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Full internationalization support. The interface is available in English, Simplified Chinese (简体中文), Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), Spanish, French, and German.
- **Mobile-First Interface**: A clean, responsive UI designed for easy use on your phone.
- **PWA Support**: Installable as a Progressive Web App for a native-like experience.
- **In-Browser Book Previewer**: Preview E-Book directly in your browser. Features Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- **Audiobook Generation**: Convert EPUB books into M4B audiobooks with chapter markers, using configurable Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers (e.g., Microsoft Edge TTS). The generated M4B files are fully compatible with audiobook servers like [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/).
- **Online Audiobook Player**: Listen to your generated M4B audiobooks directly in the browser. Your listening progress is automatically saved and synced.
- **Ask AI**: Engage in conversations with your books. This feature allows you to chat with any book in your library, ask questions about its content, get summaries, or explore themes through an AI-powered interface.
- **Calibre Integration**: Connects to your existing Calibre server to browse and search your library.
- **KOReader Sync**: Sync your reading progress and reading time with KOReader devices.
- **Smart Send to Kindle**: Automatically handles formats when sending to your Kindle. If an EPUB exists, it's sent directly. If not, the app **converts the best available format to EPUB** based on your preferences before sending, ensuring optimal compatibility.
- **Push to Anx**: Send books from your Calibre library directly to your personal Anx-reader device folder.
- **Integrated WebDAV Server**: Each user gets their own secure WebDAV folder, compatible with Anx-reader and other WebDAV clients.
- **MCP Server**: A built-in, compliant Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing AI agents and external tools to interact with your library securely.
- **User Management**: Simple, built-in user management system with distinct roles:
    - **Admin**: Full control over users, global settings, and all books.
    - **Maintainer**: Can edit all book metadata.
    - **User**: Can upload books, manage their own WebDAV library, MCP tokens, send books to Kindle, and **edit books they have uploaded**.
- **Invite-Only Registration**: Admins can generate invite codes to control user registration. This feature is enabled by default to prevent unauthorized sign-ups.
- **User-Editable Uploaded Books**: Regular users can now edit metadata for books they have uploaded. This functionality relies on a Calibre custom column named `#library` (type: `Text, with commas treated as separate tags`). When a user uploads a book, their username is automatically saved to this field. Users can then edit any book where they are listed as the owner in the `#library` field.
    - **Recommendation for Docker Users**: To enable this feature, please ensure you have a custom column in your Calibre library named `#library` (case-sensitive) with the type `Text, with commas treated as separate tags`.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deployable as a single Docker container with built-in multi-language locale support.
- **Reading Stats**: Automatically generates a personal reading statistics page, featuring a yearly reading heatmap, a list of books currently being read, and a list of finished books. The page can be shared publicly or kept private.

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your server.
- An existing Calibre server (optional, but required for most features).

### Quick Start (Docker Run)

This is the simplest way to get started.

1.  Create two directories for persistent data:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ./config
    mkdir -p ./webdav
    ```

2.  Run the Docker container with this single command:
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name anx-calibre-manager \
      -p 5000:5000 \
      -v $(pwd)/config:/config \
      -v $(pwd)/webdav:/webdav \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      ghcr.io/ptbsare/anx-calibre-manager:latest
    ```

3.  Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`. The first user to register will become the administrator. You can configure the Calibre server connection and other settings from the web interface later.

### Advanced Configuration

Here is a more detailed `docker-compose.yml` example for users who want to connect to a Calibre server and customize more options.

1.  **Find your User and Group ID (PUID/PGID):**
    Run `id $USER` on your host machine. This is recommended to avoid permission issues.

2.  **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
    ```yaml
    services:
      anx-calibre-manager:
        image: ghcr.io/ptbsare/anx-calibre-manager:latest
        container_name: anx-calibre-manager
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
        volumes:
          - /path/to/your/config:/config
          - /path/to/your/webdav:/webdav
          - /path/to/your/audiobooks:/audiobooks # Optional
          - /path/to/your/fonts:/opt/share/fonts # Optional
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - TZ=America/New_York
          - GUNICORN_WORKERS=2 # Optional
          - SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key # Change this!
          - CALIBRE_URL=http://your-calibre-server-ip:8080
          - CALIBRE_USERNAME=your_calibre_username
          - CALIBRE_PASSWORD=your_calibre_password
          - CALIBRE_DEFAULT_LIBRARY_ID=Calibre_Library
          - CALIBRE_ADD_DUPLICATES=false
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```
    *Note: Replace `/path/to/your/...` with the actual paths on your host machine.*

3.  Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Custom Fonts

The book conversion tool, `ebook-converter`, scans the `/opt/share/fonts` directory for fonts. If you encounter font-related issues when converting books with special characters (e.g., Chinese), you can provide custom fonts by mounting a local directory containing your font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.otf`) to the container's `/opt/share/fonts` path.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

### 1. Why are there no books in my Calibre list?

*   **A**: Please ensure you have started the Calibre Content Server in your Calibre client or container. It usually runs on port `8080`. Remember, this application connects to `calibre-server`, not `calibre-web` (which typically runs on port `8083`).
*   **B**: Verify that your Calibre Server URL, username, and password are correct in the settings. You can test this by opening the configured URL in your browser and trying to log in.

### 2. Why do I get a `401 Unauthorized` error when uploading/editing books?

*   **A**: Make sure the Calibre user account you configured has write permissions for the library. To check, go to `Preferences` -> `Sharing over the net` -> `User accounts` in the Calibre desktop application and ensure the "Allow write access" option is checked for the user.

### 3. Why do I get a `403 Forbidden` error when uploading/editing books?

*   **A**: This usually means you have configured an incorrect Calibre Library ID.

### 4. How do I find my `library_id`?

*   **Method 1 (Visual)**: Open your Calibre Content Server in a browser and log in. Look at the name of your library displayed on the page. The `library_id` is usually this name with spaces and special characters replaced by underscores. For example, if your library is named "Calibre Library", the ID is likely `Calibre_Library`.
*   **Method 2 (From URL)**: In the Content Server interface, click on your library's name. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. You should see a parameter like `library_id=...`. The value of this parameter is your library ID (it might be URL-encoded, so you may need to decode it).
*   **Common Default IDs**: The default library id often depends on your system's language when you first ran Calibre. Here are some common defaults:
    *   English: `Calibre_Library`
    *   French: `Bibliothèque_calibre`
    *   German: `Calibre-Bibliothek`
    *   Spanish: `Biblioteca_de_calibre`
    *   Simplified Chinese (简体中文): `Calibre_书库`
    *   Traditional Chinese (繁體中文): `calibre_書庫`

## 📖 KOReader Sync

You can sync your reading progress and reading time between your Anx library and KOReader devices. The setup involves two main steps: setting up WebDAV to access your books and configuring the sync plugin to handle progress synchronization.

### Step 1: Configure WebDAV Cloud Storage

This step allows you to browse and read your Anx library books directly in KOReader.

1.  In KOReader, navigate to `Cloud storage` -> `Add new cloud storage`.
2.  Select `WebDAV`.
3.  Fill in the details:
    -   **Server address**: Enter the WebDAV URL shown in the Anx Calibre Manager settings page (`Settings` -> `Koreader Sync Settings`). **Ensure the path ends with a `/`**.
    -   **Username**: Your Anx Calibre Manager username.
    -   **Password**: Your Anx Calibre Manager login password.
    -   **Folder**: `/anx/data/file`
4.  Tap `Connect` and save. You should now be able to see your Anx library in KOReader's file browser.

### Step 2: Install and Configure the Sync Plugin

This plugin sends your reading progress back to the Anx Calibre Manager server.

1.  **Download the Plugin**:
    -   Log in to Anx Calibre Manager.
    -   Go to `Settings` -> `Koreader Sync Settings`.
    -   Click the `Download KOReader Plugin (.zip)` button to get the plugin package.
2.  **Install the Plugin**:
    -   Unzip the downloaded file to get a folder named `anx-calibre-manager-koreader-plugin.koplugin`.
    -   Copy this entire folder to the `koreader/plugins/` directory on your KOReader device.
3.  **Restart KOReader**: Completely close and reopen the KOReader app to load the new plugin.
4.  **Configure the Sync Server**:
    -   **Important**: First, open a book from the WebDAV storage you configured in Step 1. The plugin menu is **only visible in the reading view**.
    -   In the reading view, go to `Tools (wrench icon)` -> `Next page` -> `More tools` -> `ANX Calibre Manager`.
    -   Select `Custom sync server`.
    -   **Custom sync server address**: Enter the sync server URL shown in the Anx Calibre Manager settings page (e.g., `http://<your_server_address>/koreader`).
    -   Go back to the previous menu, select `Login`, and enter your Anx Calibre Manager username and password.

Once configured, the plugin will automatically or manually sync your reading progress. You can adjust settings like sync frequency in the plugin menu. **Note: Only EPUB book progress is supported.**

## 🤖 MCP Server

This application includes a JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing external tools and AI agents to interact with your library.

### How to Use

1.  **Generate a Token**: After logging in, go to the **Settings -> MCP Settings** page. Click "Generate New Token" to create a new API token.
2.  **Endpoint URL**: The MCP server endpoint is `http://<your_server_address>/mcp`.
3.  **Authentication**: Authenticate by appending your token as a query parameter to the URL, e.g., `http://.../mcp?token=YOUR_TOKEN`.
4.  **Send Requests**: Send `POST` requests to this endpoint with a body compliant with the JSON-RPC 2.0 format.

### Prompt Examples

Here are a few examples of natural language prompts you could use with an AI agent that has access to these tools. The agent would intelligently call one or more tools to fulfill your request.

- **Simple & Advanced Search**:
  - > "Find books about Python programming."
  - > "Search for science fiction books by Isaac Asimov published after 1950."

- **Book Management**:
  - > "What are the 5 most recently added books? Send the first one to my Kindle."
  - > "Push the book 'Dune' to my Anx reader."
  - > "Generate an audiobook for the book 'The Three-Body Problem'."
  - > "What is the status of the audiobook generation for 'The Three-Body Problem'?"

- **Content Interaction & Summarization**:
  - > "Show me the table of contents for the book 'Foundation'."
  - > "Fetch the first chapter of 'Foundation' and give me a summary."
  - > "Based on the chapter 'The Psychohistorians' from the book 'Foundation', what are the main ideas of psychohistory?"
  - > "Read the entire book 'The Little Prince' and tell me what the fox's secret is."

- **Reading Statistics & Progress**:
  - > "How many words is the book 'Dune' in total, and list the word count for each chapter."
  - > "How many books have I read this year?"
  - > "What's my reading progress on 'Dune'?"
  - > "Who is the author of 'Project Hail Mary' and how long have I been reading it?"
