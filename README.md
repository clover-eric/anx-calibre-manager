- **Push to Anx**: Send books from your Calibre library directly to your personal Anx-reader device folder.
- **Integrated WebDAV Server**: Each user gets their own secure WebDAV folder, compatible with Anx-reader and other WebDAV clients.
- **MCP Server**: A built-in, compliant Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing AI agents and external tools to interact with your library securely.
- **User Management**: Simple, built-in user management system with distinct roles:
    - **Admin**: Full control over users, global settings, and all books.
    - **Maintainer**: Can edit all book metadata.
    - **User**: Can upload books, manage their own WebDAV library, MCP tokens, send books to Kindle, and **edit books they have uploaded**.
- **Invite-Only Registration**: Admins can generate invite codes to control user registration. This feature is enabled by default to prevent unauthorized sign-ups.
- **User-Editable Uploaded Books**: Regular users can now edit metadata for books they have uploaded. This functionality relies on a Calibre custom column named `#library` (type: `Text, with commas treated as separate tags`). When a user uploads a book, their username is automatically saved to this field. Users can then edit any book where they are listed as the owner in the `#library` field.
    - **Recommendation for Docker Users**: To enable this feature, please ensure you have a custom column in your Calibre library named `#library` (case-sensitive) with the type `Text, with commas treated as separate tags`.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deployable as a single Docker container with built-in multi-language locale support.
- **Reading Stats**: Automatically generates a personal reading statistics page, featuring a yearly reading heatmap, a list of books currently being read, and a list of finished books. The page can be shared publicly or kept private.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your server.
- An existing Calibre server (optional, but required for most features).

### Running with Docker

1.  **Find your User and Group ID (PUID/PGID):**
    Run `id $USER` on your host machine to get your user's UID and GID. This is crucial for avoiding permission issues with the mounted volumes.

    ```bash
    id $USER
    # Example output: uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(myuser) ...
    ```

2.  **Create directories for persistent data:**
    You need separate directories for configuration/database and for WebDAV data.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /path/to/your/config
    mkdir -p /path/to/your/webdav
    mkdir -p /path/to/your/audiobooks # Optional: for generated audiobooks
    mkdir -p /path/to/your/fonts # Optional: for custom fonts
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    You can use `docker run` or a `docker-compose.yml` file.

    **Using `docker run`:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name anx-calibre-manager \
      -p 5000:5000 \
      -e PUID=1000 \
      -e PGID=1000 \
      -e TZ="America/New_York" \
      -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
      -v /path/to/your/webdav:/webdav \
      -v /path/to/your/audiobooks:/audiobooks \ # Optional: Mount audiobook output directory
      -v /path/to/your/fonts:/opt/share/fonts \ # Optional: Mount custom fonts
      -e "GUNICORN_WORKERS=2" \
      -e "SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key" \
      -e "CALIBRE_URL=http://your-calibre-server-ip:8080" \
      -e "CALIBRE_USERNAME=your_calibre_username" \
      -e "CALIBRE_PASSWORD=your_calibre_password" \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      ghcr.io/ptbsare/anx-calibre-manager:latest
    ```

    **Using `docker-compose.yml`:**

    Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      anx-calibre-manager:
        image: ghcr.io/ptbsare/anx-calibre-manager:latest
        container_name: anx-calibre-manager
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
        volumes:
          - /path/to/your/config:/config
          - /path/to/your/webdav:/webdav
          - /path/to/your/audiobooks:/audiobooks # Optional: Mount audiobook output directory
          - /path/to/your/fonts:/opt/share/fonts # Optional: Mount custom fonts
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - TZ=America/New_York
          - GUNICORN_WORKERS=2 # Optional: Customize the number of Gunicorn worker processes
          - SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
          - CALIBRE_URL=http://your-calibre-server-ip:8080
          - CALIBRE_USERNAME=your_calibre_username
          - CALIBRE_PASSWORD=your_calibre_password
          - CALIBRE_DEFAULT_LIBRARY_ID=Calibre_Library
          - CALIBRE_ADD_DUPLICATES=false
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Custom Fonts

The book conversion tool, `ebook-converter`, scans the `/opt/share/fonts` directory for fonts. If you encounter font-related issues when converting books with special characters (e.g., Chinese), you can provide custom fonts by mounting a local directory containing your font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.otf`) to the container's `/opt/share/fonts` path.

## üìñ KOReader Sync

You can sync your reading progress and reading time between your Anx library and KOReader devices. The setup involves two main steps: setting up WebDAV to access your books and configuring the sync plugin to handle progress synchronization.

### Step 1: Configure WebDAV Cloud Storage

This step allows you to browse and read your Anx library books directly in KOReader.

1.  In KOReader, navigate to `Cloud storage` -> `Add new cloud storage`.
2.  Select `WebDAV`.
3.  Fill in the details:
    -   **Server address**: Enter the WebDAV URL shown in the Anx Calibre Manager settings page (`Settings` -> `Koreader Sync Settings`). **Ensure the path ends with a `/`**.
    -   **Username**: Your Anx Calibre Manager username.
    -   **Password**: Your Anx Calibre Manager login password.
    -   **Folder**: `/anx/data/file`
4.  Tap `Connect` and save. You should now be able to see your Anx library in KOReader's file browser.

### Step 2: Install and Configure the Sync Plugin

This plugin sends your reading progress back to the Anx Calibre Manager server.

1.  **Download the Plugin**:
    -   Log in to Anx Calibre Manager.
    -   Go to `Settings` -> `Koreader Sync Settings`.
    -   Click the `Download KOReader Plugin (.zip)` button to get the plugin package.
2.  **Install the Plugin**:
    -   Unzip the downloaded file to get a folder named `anx-calibre-manager-koreader-plugin.koplugin`.
    -   Copy this entire folder to the `koreader/plugins/` directory on your KOReader device.
3.  **Restart KOReader**: Completely close and reopen the KOReader app to load the new plugin.
4.  **Configure the Sync Server**:
    -   **Important**: First, open a book from the WebDAV storage you configured in Step 1. The plugin menu is **only visible in the reading view**.
    -   In the reading view, go to `Tools (wrench icon)` -> `Next page` -> `More tools` -> `ANX Calibre Manager`.
    -   Select `Custom sync server`.
    -   **Custom sync server address**: Enter the sync server URL shown in the Anx Calibre Manager settings page (e.g., `http://<your_server_address>/koreader`).
    -   Go back to the previous menu, select `Login`, and enter your Anx Calibre Manager username and password.

Once configured, the plugin will automatically or manually sync your reading progress. You can adjust settings like sync frequency in the plugin menu. **Note: Only EPUB book progress is supported.**

## ü§ñ MCP Server

This application includes a JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing external tools and AI agents to interact with your library.

### How to Use

1.  **Generate a Token**: After logging in, go to the **Settings -> MCP Settings** page. Click "Generate New Token" to create a new API token.
2.  **Endpoint URL**: The MCP server endpoint is `http://<your_server_address>/mcp`.
3.  **Authentication**: Authenticate by appending your token as a query parameter to the URL, e.g., `http://.../mcp?token=YOUR_TOKEN`.
4.  **Send Requests**: Send `POST` requests to this endpoint with a body compliant with the JSON-RPC 2.0 format.

### Prompt Examples

Here are a few examples of natural language prompts you could use with an AI agent that has access to these tools. The agent would intelligently call one or more tools to fulfill your request.

- **Simple & Advanced Search**:
  - > "Find books about Python programming."
  - > "Search for science fiction books by Isaac Asimov published after 1950."

- **Book Management**:
  - > "What are the 5 most recently added books? Send the first one to my Kindle."
  - > "Push the book 'Dune' to my Anx reader."
  - > "Generate an audiobook for the book 'The Three-Body Problem'."
  - > "What is the status of the audiobook generation for 'The Three-Body Problem'?"

- **Content Interaction & Summarization**:
  - > "Show me the table of contents for the book 'Foundation'."
  - > "Fetch the first chapter of 'Foundation' and give me a summary."
  - > "Based on the chapter 'The Psychohistorians' from the book 'Foundation', what are the main ideas of psychohistory?"
  - > "Read the entire book 'The Little Prince' and tell me what the fox's secret is."

- **Reading Statistics & Progress**:
  - > "How many words is the book 'Dune' in total, and list the word count for each chapter."
  - > "How many books have I read this year?"
  - > "What's my reading progress on 'Dune'?"
  - > "Who is the author of 'Project Hail Mary' and how long have I been reading it?"
